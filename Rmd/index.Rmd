The Palomarin Field Station, located at the south end of Point Reyes National Seashore, was established in 1966 and today remains an active field station year-round.

Point Blue staff train field biology interns, host organized groups and drop-in visitors, and collaborate on research with agency partners, graduate students, and others. 

With over 50 years of data, the Palomarin Field Station has made unique contributions to the fields of ornithology, ecology, and conservation. Here, you can explore some of the latest data coming from the field station.
