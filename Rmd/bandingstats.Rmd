This question is frequently asked by those who care about birds &mdash; whether they are a scientist, a birder, or simply a nature lover &mdash; and answering it is the key first step to effective bird conservation. Operating year-round since 1966, the Palomarin Field Station provides a unique long-term perspective on West Coast bird populations. 

### How has the number of birds at Palomarin changed?

One way to measure the abundance of the local bird community is the number of birds captured as part of our long-term mist-netting and banding study. The bird community changes with the seasons as migrants come and go, so we examine total capture rates of individual birds during each season and overall in each year. Capture rates have declined overall, and especially during the fall season.

</figure>

Capture rates might be affected by several factors, including: [local habitat changes](habitat.html), [climate change and local weather](climate.html), and for migratory species, changes in habitat or climate along their [migratory routes](connections.html). Because each species may responds to these changes differently, we also examine changes in the capture rates of individual species.  

### How are individual species doing?
Although we study the entire community of birds at Palomarin, we pay particular attention to a suite of focal species to understand how they are doing and what is driving any changes over time. Select a species below to see how annual capture rates of our focal species are changing over time and what this means. 

#### Year-Round Residents
Present at Palo all year, these bird species often maintain their territories even during the nonbreeding season.

#### Seasonal Migrants
Present at Palomarin only for part of the year, **Neotropical migrants** spend the spring and summer breeding season with us, then migrate to the tropics of Latin America to spend their winter.

### Why is measuring capture rates important for bird conservation?
The capture rates of birds serve as indicators of population fluctuations, which are influenced by many factors. For year-round resident species, local factors like weather and habitat change may play a large role. For seasonally migrating species, their numbers may be influenced by changes anywhere along their migration route. By examining variation in capture rates, we can examine how bird populations are changing over time, and identify some of the important factors affecting our birds.

### How did we collect these data?

All of these data are collected by staff, volunteers, and especially the hundreds of interns who have trained at Palomarin over the years. 

Since 1966, we have been mist-netting and banding birds at the Palomarin Field Station year-round. All birds are given uniquely-numbered bands provided by the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory.

### Come visit!
Watch how we collect banding data during a bird banding demonstration! Visitors can drop in and join our intern and staff biologists to learn how we collect these data &mdash; and hopefully see a bird in the hand!
